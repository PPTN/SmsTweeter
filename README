SmsTweeter
----------

This application was born out of a need to circumvent the unrealistic SMS
rates (0.75 dollars per SMS) charged by my service provider while I was on
a trip to the US. This application allows you to turn any Android phone into
an SMS gateway through Twitter.com.

This codebase requires The jTwitter library from:

I have hacked it up a little to support the new Twitter Annotations feature
that was recently previewed at the Twitter Annotations HackFest, but I am
considering removing that functionality, since it really is not required for
this application to work.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at thorinside (at) gmail.com.

Enjoy!
